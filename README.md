Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samcdavid/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

OS X El Capitan (10.11)
-----------------------

You may have problems installing Homebrew for the first time on OS X El
Capitan due to permission changes to the /usr directory (within which the Homebrew
installation is typically located). See the [Homebrew El Capitan troubleshooting instructions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/El_Capitan_and_Homebrew.md)
for steps to resolve the permissions issues that interfere with Homebrew's
installation.
